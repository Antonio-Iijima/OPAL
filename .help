A note on flag convention:
    Flags prefixed with -- are positional and MUST come before any other general
    flags, and cannot be combined with each other. Flags prefixed with a single -
    (see "FLAGS" section) can be provided in arbitrary order and combination.


OPTIONS:
    --build <pip-flags>     Install or update all dependencies. OPAL runs with an
                            internally-managed virtual environment; please ensure
                            the requirements are up-to-date. Any flags passed to 
                            -build will be transferred to pip.

    --build-docs             Generates new documentation, stored in the /docs folder.
                            Automatically removes old documentation.

    <flags> <files>         When run with flags only, OPAL runs the interpreter from
                            the terminal. <flags> and <files> may be provided in any
                            order.

    --console               Runs the textual development console IDE event logging. 
                            Must be run before IDE is launched to connect properly.

    --ide <flags>           Runs the terminal-based IDE with the provided flags. For
                            all IDE instances, -i is permanently active and does not 
                            need to be provided.

    --ide-dev <flags>       Runs the IDE in textual development mode, enabling live
                            editing of CSS and console event logging in a separate
                            terminal. Shares the same standard flags as -ide.

    <flags> : -i, -d, -p, -z
    
    -i      interactive mode
    -d      development mode
    -p      permanent extensions
