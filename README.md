OPAL (Omni-Paradigm Programming Language) seeks to unify multiple diverse programming paradigms through a consistent syntax and intuitive semantics.

OPAL is built on the core design of the [Alvin Programming Language](https://github.com/Antonio-Iijima/alvin).

OPAL is under active developement; the following programming paradigms have varying degrees of functionality:

- Imperative
  - Procedural
  - Object-oriented
- Declarative
  - Logic
- Functional
- Metaprogramming
  - Reflective
