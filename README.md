# OPAL

OPAL (Omni-Paradigm Programming Language) seeks to unify multiple diverse programming paradigms through a consistent syntax and intuitive semantics.

OPAL is built on the core design of the [Alvin Programming Language](https://github.com/Antonio-Iijima/alvin).

Currently, OPAL supports the following programming paradigms:

- Imperative
  - Procedural
  - Object-oriented
- Declarative
  - Functional
- Metaprogramming
  - Reflective
